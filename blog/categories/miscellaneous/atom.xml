    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/wordpress_to_octopress.png" width="440" title="&lsquo;Wordpress to Octopress&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You may or may not have noticed this blog has switched from a
hosted <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blog to a <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> blog.
I originally started looking at migrating the blog for a couple of
reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I love ruby and I wanted to play around with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></li>
<li>Jekyll can be deployed easily to <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a></li>
<li>Github Pages is free (as in like free beer&hellip;)</li>
<li>The amount of comment spam I am getting on WordPress was driving me
crazy (yes I know I can use Akismet)</li>
<li>I wanted to customize my blog a little more than what is allowed
with WordPress</li>
</ol>

<h2>The initial search</h2>

<p> Initially I started looking at some of the blogging tools that my
friends at the <a href="http://757rb.org">Hampton Roads Ruby Users Group</a> where using.
The first one I came across that caught my interest was <a href="http://github.com/metaskills">Ken Collins'</a> blog: <a href="http://metaskills.net">metaskills.net</a>.
The metaskills blog uses a modified version of Jekyll which Ken has added in a few items to organize and publish easier.
You can check out his code <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/metaskills.net">here</a>.</p>

<h3>First draft: Jekyll</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/octojekyll.png" width="200" title="&lsquo;OctoJekyll&rsquo;" >
I started out creating a plain Jekyll blog and looking at how the static
site generation worked.
There are plenty of resources on the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll site</a> which can show you how to install Jekyll and get it running.
You will need <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and
<a href="http://www.rubygems.org">RubyGems</a>.
If you are dabbling in Ruby or Rails, you will already have both of them.</p>

<h3>Second draft: Jekyll Bootstrap</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/Jekyll-bootstrap-screen.png" width="300" title="&lsquo;Jekyll Bootstrap Getting Started screen&rsquo;" >
While I found Jekyll pretty cool, I wanted my site to have a little bit
of styling.
Not being a graphic designer of any sort, I started looking for some
themes that I could use to modify.
After doing a little digging on Google for Jekyll themes, I found <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> by
X. Note: There is also another spin off from this project called
<a href="http://ruhoh.com">Ruhoh</a>.</p>

<h3>Final draft: Octopress</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/octopress-logo.png" width="200" title="&lsquo;Octopress Logo&rsquo;" >
I am not sure why I never noticed or found it sooner (as I am sure I
have heard of Octopress before!) &mdash; but I finally stumbled across the
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress site</a>. Octopress is a framework
designed by <a href="http://brandonmathis.com">Brandon Mathis</a> for Jekyll.</p>

<p><strong>I had finally found the toolset I was looking for!</strong></p>

<p>Octopress had plenty of themes, still stuck to Jekyll as the method of generating static
sites &mdash; and had plugins which smoothed over some of the &lsquo;warts&rsquo; of
Jekyll out of the box.</p>

<p>Here is some of the static blog-generating goodness (i.e. integrations) you will find in
Octopress:</p>

<ul>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Google+</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Disqus</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Pinboard</li>
<li>Delicious</li>
<li>Facebook likes</li>
</ul>


<p>The configuration file in a &lsquo;stock&rsquo; Octopress install is a nice YAML
layout. Here is a snippet:</p>

<p>``` yaml _config.yml</p>

<h1>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</h1>

<h1>Main Configs</h1>

<h1>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</h1>

<p>url: <a href="http://yourblogurl.com">http://yourblogurl.com</a>
title: Your Blog Name
subtitle: Some catchy subtitle..
author: Your Name Here
simple_search: <a href="http://google.com/search">http://google.com/search</a>
description: This will show in the META tags
```</p>

<p>Making changes is as easy as changing the appropriate key/value
pair and then from the terminal, run: <code>rake preview</code> to view it on <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a></p>

<p>Deploying the site is just as easy:
<code>bash
rake generate   #generate the static site content
rake deploy     #deploy the site to your deploy location (i.e. github)
</code>
You can even abbreviate deployment to: <code>rake gen_deploy</code></p>

<p>Octopress also has plenty of themes as a starting point for customizing your own blog.
The github repo <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">here</a> is a good starting point for 3rd party Octopress themes.</p>

<p>I am now (<em>for the time being</em>) sold on Octopress and will be using it for
my posts going forward. If you are in the market for a new static
blogging platform, give it a try &mdash; I think you will be pleasantly
surprised.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-05T09:05:00-04:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I usually use a desktop PC and my Macbook Air on a daily basis during the week. In going back and forth between Windows and Mac OS X, I have noticed a couple of things that have hammered home the point that hardware is not the only thing Apple does well &mdash; software is too.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="/images/password_protect_files_snowleopard.jpg" width="350" title="Save as PDF on Mac" >
The first thing that occurred to me is Mac OS X has had the ability to print and edit PDF files at least since Mac OS X Leopard. With Windows, I need to download some type of PDF print driver and an Adobe viewer. Mac OS X has preview (which works for both images and PDF files), which will let me view and do some light editing on a PDF file as wells annotate.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/notification-center.jpg" title="Mac OS Notification Center" >
The second thing I noticed was Mac OS X Lions notifications center provides not only a nice area to see your email and app notifications, but also an easy way to post to Twitter and Facebook. Growl notification is baked in as well &mdash; I have to download a growl client for windows (and the app has to use Growl).</p>

<p>I am not quite sure why Windows doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;batteries included&rdquo; when it comes to PDF files, but it is just a nice feature that Apple has added into Mac OS X. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I have used Windows for a long time &mdash; and I was a Windows user before I used a Mac. Windows gets a lot of things right and I will continue to use Windows as well &mdash; but Apple seems to be getting very good at sanding down the &ldquo;friction points&rdquo; you encounter with software to make for an easier, elegant user experience.</p>

<p>Sometimes its just nice for things to work as you intend them to and to serendipitously find some functionality that is often overlooked&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well today was a productive day: I changed the rear brake pads and rotors for my car today.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/car_repair_8bit.jpg" width="325">
Yes, I know this is not as great an automotive accomplishment as rebuilding an engine. However, I find something innately satisfying with getting your hands dirty and figuring out how to do something you normally don&rsquo;t do. I have always enjoyed figuring out how to fix things and perhaps that is what drew me into computers and software.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I believe we have a lot of technology (cars being one of them) that most of us use and take for granted. When this technology needs to be maintained/repaired many of us lack the knowledge to do so. My personal goal to counter this lack of &lsquo;automotive know-how&rsquo; is to fix whatever can on my car, whenever I can &mdash; and hopefully save money in the process.</p>

<p>Here are some of the resources I have found helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oreillyauto.com/">O'Reilly auto parts</a> &ndash; my favorite auto parts store.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.haynes.com/mole-video">Haynes Manuals Online</a> &ndash; a must have for DIY auto repair.</li>
</ul>
