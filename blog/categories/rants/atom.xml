    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I usually use a desktop PC and my Macbook Air on a daily basis during the week. In going back and forth between Windows and Mac OS X, I have noticed a couple of things that have hammered home the point that hardware is not the only thing Apple does well &mdash; software is too.</p>

The first thing that occurred to me is Mac OS X has had the ability to print and edit PDF files at least since Mac OS X Leopard. With Windows, I need to download some type of PDF print driver and an Adobe viewer. Mac OS X has preview (which works for both images and PDF files), which will let me view and do some light editing on a PDF file as wells annotate.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/notification-center.jpg" title="Mac OS Notification Center" >
The second thing I noticed was Mac OS X Lions notifications center provides not only a nice area to see your email and app notifications, but also an easy way to post to Twitter and Facebook. Growl notification is baked in as well &mdash; I have to download a growl client for windows (and the app has to use Growl).</p>

<p>I am not quite sure why Windows doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;batteries included&rdquo; when it comes to PDF files, but it is just a nice feature that Apple has added into Mac OS X. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I have used Windows for a long time &mdash; and I was a Windows user before I used a Mac. Windows gets a lot of things right and I will continue to use Windows as well &mdash; but Apple seems to be getting very good at sanding down the &ldquo;friction points&rdquo; you encounter with software to make for an easier, elegant user experience.</p>

<p>Sometimes its just nice for things to work as you intend them to and to serendipitously find some functionality that is often overlooked&hellip;</p>

OK: I like Windows 8 so far. I think it is a pretty good OS. My only gripe with it so far is that lately it has been stalling on the updates. The screen will say something to the effect of &ldquo;Do not power down&rdquo; and &ldquo;Installing update 4 of 6&rdquo;. It will do this for several hours&hellip;with occasional hard disk activity. Eventually I have to pull the battery on my laptop to restart it. I am thinking: Really??</p>
