Well today was a productive day: I changed the rear brake pads and rotors for my car today.

Yes, I know this is not as great an automotive accomplishment as rebuilding an engine. However, I find something innately satisfying with getting your hands dirty and figuring out how to do something you normally don't do. I have always enjoyed figuring out how to fix things and perhaps that is what drew me into computers and software.

I believe we have a lot of technology (cars being one of them) that most of us use and take for granted. When this technology needs to be maintained/repaired many of us lack the knowledge to do so. My personal goal to counter this lack of 'automotive know-how' is to fix whatever can on my car, whenever I can -- and hopefully save money in the process.

Here are some of the resources I have found helpful:

* [O'Reilly auto parts](http://www.oreillyauto.com/) - my favorite auto parts store.
* [Haynes Manuals Online](http://www.haynes.com/mole-video) - a must have for DIY auto repair.
