With at least 3 locations that my calendar events are in (Google
Calendar, MS Outlook, and Mac Calendar/iCloud) I am looking to
consolidate my calendars.

Right now with I have a couple of different calendars on these calendar
applications - my personal calendar, work calendar, etc. etc.
This causes the problem of duplicate events on the calendars.
