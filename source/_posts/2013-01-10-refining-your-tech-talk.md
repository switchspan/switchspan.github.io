Last night I did the first tech talk ([RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) and [EasyNetQ](http://easynetq.com/)) that I have done in at least a one or two years at the [Hampton Roads .NET Users Group (HRNUG)](http://www.hrnug.org/).

I try to have respect for my audience when giving these talks and work provide them with something that is entertaining as well as educational. I wouldn’t want my time wasted with a bad presentation – so I don’t want to waste the audience’s time either! In giving my talks, I strive to emulate the great tech speakers and educators like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) and [‘Uncle Bob’ Martin](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/robert-martin).

[Rob Connery](http://wekeroad.com/) does a great interview of Scott Hanselman in his Full Throttle series on Tekpub on [how Scott prepares for a tech talk](http://tekpub.com/productions/ft_speaker). If you are serious about giving tech talks, I highly recommend you look at it.

Tech talks can through you some curve-balls that; if you are willing to pay attention, can provide some teachable moments that you can use to refine future tech talks. I found my teachable moments in a couple of areas while giving the presentation:

1. Make sure to use your phone or watch as a timer – to help you keep the ‘pace’ through your tech talk. Setting it to the max talk time and having it count down will work – or have a half way point set and check to see where you are in the total presentation I was allotted 60 – 75 minutes, but my talk came in at around 45 minutes because I though I was running out of time. These extra minutes could have been used to dive deeper into my code examples! 

2. If you haven’t been playing with PowerPoint lately, [brush up on the start (F5) / restart (SHIFT-F5) keystrokes](http://presentationsoft.about.com/od/powerpoint101/ss/shortcuts.htm). When you are in the middle of a presentation, it can disrupt the flow of the talk when you have to forward to the last slide you where one. I rehearsed my talk, except I didn’t rehearse switching into my demos. While F5 will start a slideshow in Power Point, it always starts at the beginning. In the middle of the talk, I couldn’t remember what the restart keystroke was, so I had to forward from the beginning slide each time I stopped for a demo. This can be a little choppy for the viewers.

3. If you use any other tools, such as [ZoomIt](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897434.aspx) – make sure you set their key mappings to what you want them to be and make sure you practice using it in your talk rehearsal.

 Fortunately I get a do-over next month with the [757 Ruby Users Group](http://757rb.org/). I have some tweaking to do to the presentation in order to tailor it for a slightly different audience, but the changes are really just the demos and substituting the [amqp gem](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp) for EasyNetQ. But my lessons learned on the presentation flow will definitely be incorporated.

 I am sure there will be many more of these teachable moments in the future…
