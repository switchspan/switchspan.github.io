I usually use a desktop PC and my Macbook Air on a daily basis during the week. In going back and forth between Windows and Mac OS X, I have noticed a couple of things that have hammered home the point that hardware is not the only thing Apple does well -- software is too.

The first thing that occurred to me is Mac OS X has had the ability to print and edit PDF files at least since Mac OS X Leopard. With Windows, I need to download some type of PDF print driver and an Adobe viewer. Mac OS X has preview (which works for both images and PDF files), which will let me view and do some light editing on a PDF file as wells annotate.

The second thing I noticed was Mac OS X Lions notifications center provides not only a nice area to see your email and app notifications, but also an easy way to post to Twitter and Facebook. Growl notification is baked in as well -- I have to download a growl client for windows (and the app has to use Growl).

I am not quite sure why Windows doesn't have "batteries included" when it comes to PDF files, but it is just a nice feature that Apple has added into Mac OS X. Don't get me wrong: I have used Windows for a long time -- and I was a Windows user before I used a Mac. Windows gets a lot of things right and I will continue to use Windows as well -- but Apple seems to be getting very good at sanding down the "friction points" you encounter with software to make for an easier, elegant user experience.

Sometimes its just nice for things to work as you intend them to and to serendipitously find some functionality that is often overlooked...
