My name is Ken Taylor and this blog is my spot for writing mainly about programming and technology(yes, I know there are already more than enough of this type of blog…). Hopefully I will have an occasional humorous post. 

I am a software developer from Suffolk, VA. I have used quite a few different technologies and have (hopefully) grown as a professional in the process.
