## About Ken Taylor

{% img left /images/profile_pic_ken_taylor.jpg 200 300 'A picture of Ken' %}
My name is Ken Taylor and this blog is my spot for writing mainly about programming and technology (yes, I know there are already more than enough of this type of blog…). Hopefully I will have an occasional humorous post. 

I am a software developer from Suffolk, VA. I have used quite a few different technologies and have (hopefully) grown as a professional in the process.

## About SwitchSpan

SwitchSpan is just a name I picked for the blog and my Github
account. I just like the sound of the name and it really has no
other relevance. :)
If you are curious, this blog was writting using Vim, and published via
[Octopress](http://octopress.org)/[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). The theme is a slightly modified copy of the [fabric](http://github.com/panks/fabric) theme by [Pankaj Kumar](http://panks.me).
